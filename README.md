# ðŸ§© TS Playground

TypeScript experiments and architecture sketches by **risk**.  
Code featured in my [Zenn articles](https://zenn.dev/risk).

ðŸ’¡ This repository contains small TypeScript experiments,  
design pattern trials, and clean architecture prototypes, etc.

Each directory or file is mostly self-contained â€”  
feel free to explore any of them.

> _Playground means: you can break it, fix it, or rebuild it â€” thatâ€™s the point._ ðŸŽˆ
